This userscript improves the user experience of reading comments on The Stranger's online articles and on Slog and Line Out blog posts.

## Commenter filtering

Through DOM injection, this userscript provides "hide" links next to each commenter. After hiding a commenter, their comments are seamlessly collapsed on each page load. A list of hidden commenters is also injected into the right sidebar.
